### HI THERE 👋

#### I am Prk.

_I'm currently learning Japanese. (it's really challenging.)_

I am a web **backend programmer** with proficiency in languages such as [Go](https://go.dev/) and [PHP](https://php.net/). Simultaneously, I've delved into frontend languages like HTML + CSS, JavaScript (TypeScript), and frontend framework [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/).
Starting from 2023, I am gradually transitioning from closed-source development to open-source development and have open-sourced multiple pieces of software. You can visit my [GitHub](https://github.com/imPrk0) page for more details. Additionally, I am active on [X (formerly Twitter)](https://x.com/imPrk_), where you can engage with me anytime. Of course, you can also find me on [BlueSky](https://bsky.app/profile/prk0.bsky.social), Mastodon, the Chinese instance of [mas.to](https://mas.to/@prk), [长毛象中文站](https://m.cmx.im/@prk), and [DVD.CHAT](https://dvd.chat/@prk). Beyond my primary occupation, I am also a [YouTuber](https://www.youtube.com/@imPrk_). _(Currently, [my YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@imPrk_) primarily uses Chinese as I interact more with the Chinese community. However, in the future, I plan to create content in English as well.)_
